Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. It creates a .git file with the current state of all the filess. To establish
   a baseline.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
   repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. The staging area is for stuff that you want to commit. The repository
   is for stuff already committed. The working directory is for stuff
   that isn't yet commitworthy. The staging area lets me park code I want
   to commit and keep it separate from code-in-progress.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
   logical change?
A. Only put the fixes for one logical change into the staging area, then
   commit them befor putting antyhing else into the staging area.

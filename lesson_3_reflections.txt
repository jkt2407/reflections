Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When you're working on the same project from more than one computer. However, even if
   you're working on a single computer, it's a good idea to have a copy of your project
   saved in the cloud, just in case.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
   automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. You don't want changes coming down that will break what you are working on.
